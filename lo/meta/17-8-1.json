The number of Internet users has increased substantially over the last decade and access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, work and do business. Internet uptake is a key indicator tracked by policy makers and others to measure the development of the information society and the growth of Internet content \u2013 including user-generated content \u2013 provides access to increasing amounts of information and services.</p><p>Despite growth in networks, services and applications, information and communication technology (ICT) access and use is still far from equally distributed, and many people cannot yet benefit from the potential of the Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of Internet use as a development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains. Classificatory variables for individuals using the Internet \u2013such as age, sex, education level or labour force status \u2013 can help identify digital divides in individuals using the Internet. This information can contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.</p><p>The proportion of individuals using the Internet is an established indicator and also one of the three ICT-related Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators (for Target 8F). It is part of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014). It is also included in the ITU ICT Development Index, and thus considered a key metric for international comparisons of ICT developments.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p> We were granted fund by local government for first three years, need to extend period of this required survey, beside financial support we also need the technical assistance.  </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>2022</p>","SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Proportion of individuals using the Internet</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"<p>IT_USE_II99</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 17.8: Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity-building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p> House house Survey </p>","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD":"<p> Need conducts survery</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p>This is the proportion of individuals who used the Internet from any location in the last three months.
