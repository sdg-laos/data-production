It is expressed as a percentage. </p><p><strong>Concepts: </strong>Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. </p><p>Though strictly related, \u201cundernourishment\u201d as defined here is different from the physical conditions of \u201cmalnutrition\u201d and \u201cundernutrition\u201d as it refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the outcome in terms of nutritional status.  By now the term \u201cundernourishment\u201d has long been associated with the indicator. </p><p>While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent (%)</p>"},"indicator":"2.1.1","target_id":"2.1","sdg_goal":"2","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"02-01-01","indicator_name":"\u0ead\u0eb1\u0e94\u0e95\u0eb2\u0eaa\u0ec8\u0ea7\u0e99\u0e82\u0ead\u0e87\u0e81\u0eb2\u0e99\u0e82\u0eb2\u0e94\u0eaa\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ead\u0eb2\u0eab\u0eb2\u0e99","graph_title":"\u0ead\u0eb1\u0e94\u0e95\u0eb2\u0eaa\u0ec8\u0ea7\u0e99\u0e82\u0ead\u0e87\u0e81\u0eb2\u0e99\u0e82\u0eb2\u0e94\u0eaa\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ead\u0eb2\u0eab\u0eb2\u0e99"}
