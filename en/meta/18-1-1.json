More than forty years after the end of the 1964-1973 Indochina Conflict, unexploded ordnance (UXO) remains a major humanitarian and socio-economic challenge to the country, causing deaths and injuries, limiting access to potentially productive land and adding substantial costs to processes of development. The Government of Lao PDR has been active in the process of clearance since shortly after the conflict. Lao PDR has advocated for the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and hosted the first Meeting of States Parties in 2010. Thus, Lao PDR embraced the UXO issue as a key development matter by locally establishing SDG 18. </p>","QUALITY_MGMNT":"<p>Managing the quality of the indicator is guided by the national survey procedures (NSP) developed with participation from all stakeholders and approved by the National Regulatory Authority in January 2015.
