{"STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>This indicator provides information on the mean hourly earnings from paid employment of employees by sex, occupation, age and disability status. </p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers\u2019 contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. </p><p>For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees\u2019 gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees.</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Use 2 type of data source </p><ol><li>The Labour Force Survey 2017 (every 5 years)</li><li>and administrative data from Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare annually</li></ol>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>8.5 By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"<p>Average hourly earnings</p>","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"<p>Any economic statistics that is used for other SDG indicator\u00a0</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>8.5.1 Average hourly earnings of female/ male employees, by sector, age group and persons with disabilities</p>","SDG_GOAL":"<p>SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>ILO</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>2022</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>The variety of possible sources for statistics on earnings greatly hinders international comparability, as each type of source has its own coverage, scope and characteristics. It would not be fully accurate to compare, for example, hourly earnings from a labour force survey for one country with hourly earnings from an establishment survey for another. The use of non-standard definitions and the heterogeneity of operational criteria applied further hamper cross-country comparisons. </p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Earnings are a key aspect of quality of employment and living conditions.
