It reflects the\u00a0inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so,\u00a0even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of\u00a0the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the\u00a0labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can\u00a0be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with\u00a0recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not\u00a0in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.\u00a0</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT":"<p>Managing the quality of the indicator is guided by the Lao PDR Statistics Law of 2017 and in accordance with the recommendations of the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE":"<p>Data are validated in accordance with the international statistical standards</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"<p>The estimates derived for each year are compared to previous years to ensure that estimates are prepared consistently from year to year.
